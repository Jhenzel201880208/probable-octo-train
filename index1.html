  <h2>Calle Crisologo, Vigan</h2>
  <p>
    Travel back in time as you stroll along the streets of Calle Crisologo in Vigan. This 16th-century town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist spot in the Philippines, quietly boasts old-world charm and Spanish colonial architecture and is the top attraction in Vigan, Ilocos tours. 

The town has successfully managed to preserve the historic district where you can still find calesas (horse-drawn carriages). Sample the famous and delicious Ilocos empanada, and walk along cobbled streets lined up with souvenir shops selling pottery and Abel Iloko weaves, among the many things to see and do when in Vigan

  <h2>Intramuros and Fort Santiago, Manila</h2>
  <p>
    Take a stroll through history lane within the walled city of Intramuros in Manila. This 64-hectare Spanish fortress was erected by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and was destroyed by the end of World War II.

However, the ruins remain very alive today and are some of the top Instagrammable places in Manila. The area can be explored via Intramuros tours or a Manila bike tour. The area has become home to several universities and establishments. Here, you can find centuries-old churches and historical places in Manila like the grand Manila Cathedral and San Agustin Church, the oldest church in the Philippines, making the area a great place for a Philippines staycation.

Another Intramuros attraction is Fort Santiago, a citadel that served as headquarters for armies and foreign powers. It is a historically significant site where the national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, was imprisoned before his execution.

  <h2>Kawasan Falls, Cebu</h2>
  <p>
    If you like jumping into or swimming in cool cascading waters, Kawasan Falls in Cebu hits the sweet spot. It is a multi-layered waterfall in the town of Badian and is best known for its turquoise waters.

With a height of 40 meters, the first cascade, or level, is where most visitors stay, swim, and enjoy a natural water massage on board a bamboo raft. A 10-minute trek takes you up to the quieter second cascade.

  <h2>Kayangan Lake, Coron, Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    Undoubtedly one of the most photographed and iconic destinations in the Philippines is Kayangan Lake in Coron, Palawan. Going on a Kayangan Lake Coron tour will allow you to see its lagoon that is a dreamy mix of blues and greens glistening on a bright, sunny day. It should definitely be on your Coron Palawan itinerary.
Kayangan Lake tours will take you to the jagged limestone cliffs and islets surrounding the lake. All these add up to a dramatic landscape, best seen from a 10-minute climb up a hill. Curiously, this view is not of the actual Kayangan Lake but the area where the tour boats park, but it is still breathtaking nonetheless.

As spectacular as the views are above ground, the real gem is hidden underneath the lake’s glass-like waters. Rock formations and schools of fish abound, making the area a favorite snorkeling and free-diving spot for visitors and one of the most popular Coron Palawan tourist spots.

  <h2>Rizal Park, Manila</h2>
  <p>
    This 60-hectare urban park is where you will see the Rizal Monument, marking the execution site of the country’s national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal. Manila Bay’s breeze keeps the Philippine flag waving from a 46-meter flagpole fronting his monument.

The park also features manicured gardens, ponds, and a wide water fountain that lights up and dances to Filipino tunes by sunset. The park area is also home to a network of National Museums that you can visit.

  <h2>Tubbataha Reef, Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    Tubbataha Reef is regarded as one of the top diving spots in the Philippines, and perhaps, the world. Located at the heart of the Sulu Sea, it is considered a center of marine biodiversity and a haven not just for divers but marine conservationists as well. The only way to get to this marine sanctuary is through a liveaboard vessel from Puerto Princesa, Palawan. 

The access may be challenging, but it is probably what is keeping the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park teeming with some of the most unique underwater life in the world. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was nominated as part of the “New Seven Wonders of the Natural World.”
